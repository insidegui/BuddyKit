/// Verbose logging for UI-related code.
/// - Parameters:
///   - message: The content to be logged.
///   - file: Leave as default.
///   - line: Leave as default.
///
/// This function is designed to be used in user interface code for logging verbose UI-related events that should
/// not be logged in release builds, or even in every session of a debug build.
///
/// When running in a SwiftUI preview, the message is logged using `print()` so that it shows up in Xcode's previews console.
/// When running the app normally, the message is logged using `Logger` so that it can be filtered in Xcode's console or in the Console app.
///
/// **Messages are only logged in SwiftUI previews or if the `VerboseUILoggingEnabled` user defaults key is set to `true`.**
///
/// To allow logging when running from Xcode, you can add "-VerboseUILoggingEnabled YES" as one of the "Arguments Passed On Launch" in your app's scheme settings.
///
/// - note: This function has no performance impact in release builds because its first argument is an autoclosure and its inlined implementation is compiled out when the `DEBUG` flag is set,
/// ensuring that the logged message/content is never evaluated in release builds.
