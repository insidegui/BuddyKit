# BuddyKit

A collection of utilities I use in pretty much all of my apps and command-line tools.

## Don't use this ðŸ˜…

This is a Swift package and you could just add it to your dependencies and use the libraries provided, but I'm not making this code public with the intention of keeping a well-maintained open-source package.

The reason this code is made open is mostly for my own convenience, so that I can open-source other projects that depend on it, and to serve as a source of useful little extensions you can just copy and paste as needed.
